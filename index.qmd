## Abstract

> In today’s hyper-connected environment, organizations increasingly rely on distributed expertise and cross-boundary knowledge exchange to remain competitive. While Communities of Practice (CoPs) have been widely recognized as essential structures for collective learning, the rise of digital technologies has enabled a new form of community—extended Communities of Practice (eCoPs)—that transcend geographical, organizational, and temporal boundaries. These digitally mediated, fluid networks connect diverse practitioners and support continuous, practice-oriented knowledge sharing. Despite their growing importance, theoretical and methodological tools for understanding the temporal dynamics of knowledge exchange in eCoPs remain limited. Existing research often relies on static or aggregated network representations that obscure the sequential, event-based structure of knowledge interactions. To address this gap, we apply Relational Event Models (REM), a statistical framework designed to analyze time-stamped interaction sequences and capture how prior events shape subsequent behavior. Using four months of interaction data from CloudBro, an online professional community of IT practitioners, we examine 216 relational events generated by 59 participants across 309 posts in 89 discussion threads. By leveraging REM’s temporal granularity, this study elucidates how conversational sequences, reciprocity, and emergent attention patterns structure knowledge flows in an extended CoP. The findings contribute to theory development on digital knowledge communities and offer practical insights for designing and managing effective eCoPs.
